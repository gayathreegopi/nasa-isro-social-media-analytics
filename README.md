# NASA and ISRO on Social Media

This was a collaborative final project done in the Analytics for Unstructured Data class at UT Austin.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes public sentiment toward NASA and ISRO by examining unstructured data from social media platforms, including Reddit and Instagram. We collected and processed posts, performing topic modeling and sentiment analysis to understand perceptions of each organization in areas such as innovation, cost-effectiveness, and impact. Our findings reveal that NASA is celebrated for its technological advancements and deep space missions, while ISRO is acclaimed for its efficiency and focus on national development. These insights highlight distinct public preferences and offer recommendations for social media strategies to enhance engagement and align with public interests.

## Contributions

- Curated and conducted similarity and sentiment analysis using Python libraries such as spaCy and BERT on Reddit posts from various forums.
- Selected attributes relevant to both NASA and ISRO to benchmark their social media posts and mentions on Reddit.
- Created an evaluation score that mapped posts to the most relevant attributes describing NASA and ISRO's progress.

## Important Findings

1. **Distinct Public Perceptions**:
   - NASA is recognized for its technological innovations and collaborations in deep space exploration.
   - ISRO is celebrated for its cost-effective missions and contributions to national development.

2. **Engagement Patterns on Social Media**:
   - NASA’s posts featuring stunning space imagery, such as celestial bodies and Earth views, garnered the highest engagement on Instagram.
   - ISRO’s posts focusing on technical scenes and professional appearances showed lower engagement, suggesting a preference for more visually captivating content.

3. **Top Themes in Public Sentiment**:
   - On Reddit, discussions about both agencies often centered around key attributes such as reliability, payload capabilities, and mission success.
   - Conversations about NASA emphasized collaboration and aerospace advancements, while those about ISRO highlighted innovation and national pride.

4. **Image Analytics Recommendations**:
   - For improved public engagement, ISRO could focus on visually appealing images of Earth, the Moon, and Mars.
   - Reducing the emphasis on professional appearances may also help improve engagement, aligning content with what resonates most with audiences.

5. **Future Applications**:
   - **Enhanced Real-Time Insights**: Future work can involve leveraging large language models (LLMs) and real-time data streams to track sentiment changes dynamically and provide immediate recommendations for social media strategy adjustments.
   - **Predictive Modeling**: Develop predictive models that forecast shifts in public sentiment related to upcoming space missions or events, allowing for proactive engagement strategies.
   - **Content Optimization**: Explore the use of AI-driven content generation tools to tailor social media posts more effectively to the preferences and interests of specific audience segments.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and sentiment analysis.
- **NLP Libraries**: spaCy, scikit-learn, and BERT for text processing, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis.
- **Data Sources**: Reddit and Instagram posts related to NASA and ISRO.
